Last Name: Mark

Problems with Design:

The registration form was a bit lengthy, and it took some time to fill out all the required fields.
I found it a bit confusing to understand the specific format expected for the phone number.

Comments That Surprised You:

I was pleasantly surprised by how visually appealing the designer showcase was on the site. It made me feel excited about participating in the fashion show.
I didn't expect the registration process to be so thorough, which is actually a good thing because it ensures that only serious designers get to participate.

Changes to Interface Based on Feedback:

To improve the interface, I would suggest simplifying the registration process by providing clearer instructions and examples for phone number formatting.
I'd also maintain the visually appealing designer showcase but maybe add a search or filter feature for easier browsing.

Problems with Design:

While registering, I encountered a minor issue with the "Brand Type" field. It was not entirely clear what was expected in that field, and I hesitated about what to put.

Comments That Surprised You:

The color scheme and interface are awesome 

Changes to Interface Based on Feedback:

To improve the interface, I would suggest adding placeholder text or a brief description next to the "Brand Type" field to clarify the information expected.
